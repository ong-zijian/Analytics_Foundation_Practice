# Analytics_Foundation_Practice
This is a repository that I will use to upload all of my practices for my analytics foundations. 

This will range from basic Pandas up to Machine Learning models like Kmeans and Linear Regression. 
Please feel free to feedback on anything that I have done incorrectly so that I can learn from it.
